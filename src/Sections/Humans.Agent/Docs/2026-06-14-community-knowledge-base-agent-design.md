# Community knowledge base for the agent

**Status:** Draft for review
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Branch:** `feat/community-kb-agent`
**Sections touched:** Agent (horizontal). New on-demand corpus + index + a startup warm-up. No DB, no vertical-section data.

## Context

The agent today answers from authoritative app docs. It already runs the exact pattern this feature needs:

- `AgentPreloadCorpusBuilder` (singleton) assembles a small **section index** — one tagline per section — plus the access matrix, glossaries, route map, and FAQ. The assembled string is cached under `agent:preload:{config}` with a **30-minute absolute TTL** and inlined into the Anthropic system prompt (server-side prompt-cached by `AnthropicClient`).
- The model reads the index, picks a section, and calls **`fetch_section_guide`** → `AgentSectionDocReader.ReadAsync(key)` → `IGuideContentSource.GetMarkdownAsync("docs/sections", key)` (Octokit raw fetch from `nobodies-collective/Humans`, memory-cached, sliding TTL `GuideSettings.CacheTtlHours`). `fetch_feature_spec` works the same way against `docs/features/`.

So an index + on-demand fetch tool already exists; this feature is a **parallel instance of it** pointed at a new corpus. The 30-minute preload TTL and the readers' sliding TTLs are also unnecessary — see Goal 3 and Component 5: the agent's content is GitHub-backed and the right model is preload-once-and-hold, not expire-and-refetch.

Separately, `nca-discord/knowledge-base/` holds knowledge extracted from the community Discord by an offline pipeline. Its `public/` folder contains clean, topic-partitioned markdown (`FAQ-general.md`, `FAQ-comms.md`, `FAQ-site.md`, `RETROSPECTIVE-2027.md`, …), each shaped as: `# Title` / `Last updated: …` / `## Overview` / `## Key facts` / `## FAQ` (bold question, answer). The first window is ~4 public docs; ~4 months of further windows are coming — expect this to grow ~100×, with ~50+ facts per topic file. A sibling `confidential/` folder (board dossiers, internal docs) is **out of bounds**.

This knowledge is community-sourced and **not 100% accurate** — the agent must surface that whenever it relies on it.

## Goals

1. Give the agent a **community FAQ corpus** it can consult: an always-present index of available topics + an on-demand fetch tool, mirroring `fetch_section_guide`.
2. **Provenance caveat** on every use: the agent tells users community knowledge is unofficial and may be outdated.
3. **Drop the TTLs on the agent's GitHub-backed caches and preload them once, early in startup (non-blocking), held in RAM for the process lifetime.** The current 30-minute preload TTL and the readers' sliding TTLs are pointless churn: the content is GitHub-backed and only effectively changes at release, and a release restarts the process. Restart *is* the refresh; nothing expires in between.

## Non-goals

- **No in-app ingestion.** Cleanup, Discord-username→display-name translation, and the copy from `nca-discord/public/` into this repo are a **manual periodic step Peter runs** (the review/accuracy gate). The app only reads the committed result. The ingestion tooling is out of scope for this spec.
- **No DB / entity / repository.** This is GitHub-backed content read into `IMemoryCache`, exactly like the guide and section docs. No vertical-section data, so no repository or `IServiceRead` surface.
- **No embeddings / vector search.** The agent routes by reading index descriptions, as it already does for section guides. Keyword/topic granularity is sufficient at this scale.
- **No auto-sync from nca-discord**, no topic→team mapping table, no admin UI for the corpus.
- **The `confidential/` folder is never copied into this repo** and the reader never reads outside `docs/community-kb/`.

## Design decision — vendor into this repo, reuse the existing reader pattern

**Source of truth the app reads:** `docs/community-kb/` in the **Humans repo** (`origin`/`upstream`), populated by Peter's manual pull-clean-translate step. Rejected reading `nca-discord/public/` directly: it would couple production to a personal repo, bypass the review gate, and risk the adjacent `confidential/` folder. Vendoring reuses the existing `IGuideContentSource` Octokit fetch and `GitHub:AccessToken` end-to-end with zero new auth.

**Discovery:** dynamic directory listing of `docs/community-kb/`, using the pattern `GitHubLegalDocumentConnector.DiscoverLanguageFilesAsync` already uses (`GetAllContentsByRef`). Rejected the hardcoded `GuideFiles.cs`-style list: at ~100× growth, new topic files must appear without a code change. New files become available to the agent the moment Peter commits them.

**Separate tool, not folded into `fetch_section_guide`:** authoritative section guides and community FAQ must never blur. A distinct tool lets the result carry a provenance wrapper and keeps the index labelled as community-sourced.

## Component 1 — `CommunityFaqReader` (Infrastructure / Services / Preload)

Mirror `AgentSectionDocReader` (same folder, same registration/interface shape — follow whatever that reader does exactly; do not invent new surface). Responsibilities:

- **`ListTopicsAsync()`** — dynamic directory listing of `docs/community-kb/` via the Octokit path used by `GitHubLegalDocumentConnector`. Returns the set of topic keys (filename without `.md`) plus, for each, a parsed **index entry**: the `# H1` title, the `Last updated:` date, and the first non-empty paragraph of `## Overview` (fallback: just the H1). Held in RAM with **no expiration** (key prefix `community-kb:index`) — populated by the startup warm-up, refreshed only on restart.
- **`ReadAsync(topic)`** — validate `topic` against `[A-Za-z0-9\-_]+` (path-traversal guard, like `AgentFeatureSpecReader`) **and** against the discovered topic set; fetch `docs/community-kb/{topic}.md` via `IGuideContentSource.GetMarkdownAsync`; cache per file with **no expiration** (key prefix `community-kb:`). Returns the raw markdown.

No DbContext, no cross-section call. Pure GitHub-backed infrastructure service.

## Component 2 — the index (in the preloaded corpus)

In `AgentPreloadCorpusBuilder.BuildAsync`, after the section index, append a **Community FAQ index** block built from `CommunityFaqReader.ListTopicsAsync()`:

```
## Community FAQ (community-sourced — unofficial, may be outdated)
- **comms** — Comms & website: open-source site, comms-lead structure, meeting-summary norm. (last updated 2026-02-01)
- **general** — What the NCA is, the event, joining Discord/newsletter, leads/volunteers apply via Humans. (last updated 2026-02-01)
- …
```

Included regardless of `AgentPreloadConfig` tier — the index is one line per file and negligible even at 100× (dozens of lines). Full docs are **never** inlined; they are fetched on demand. The block header itself states the corpus is unofficial, so the model is primed before it ever fetches.

## Component 3 — the `fetch_community_faq` tool (Application + Infrastructure)

1. `AgentToolNames` — add `public const string FetchCommunityFaq = "fetch_community_faq";` and include it in the `All` set.
2. `AgentPromptAssembler.BuildToolDefinitions()` — add `new AnthropicToolDefinition("fetch_community_faq", "Fetch a community-sourced FAQ topic (unofficial, may be outdated) by its topic key from the Community FAQ index.", """{"type":"object","properties":{"topic":{"type":"string"}},"required":["topic"]}""")`.
3. `AgentToolDispatcher.DispatchAsync()` — add `case AgentToolNames.FetchCommunityFaq:` that parses `topic`, calls `CommunityFaqReader.ReadAsync(topic)`, and returns the content **wrapped** with a provenance header:

   ```
   SOURCE: community Discord FAQ · NOT official · may be outdated · last updated {date}
   When you use anything below, tell the user it comes from community discussion and may not be official.

   {file markdown}
   ```

   Unknown/invalid topic → `AnthropicToolResult(IsError: true)` listing valid topics (same shape as the existing readers' error path).
4. Inject `CommunityFaqReader` into `AgentToolDispatcher`'s constructor.

## Component 4 — the caveat (Peter's option C)

- **Policy rule** appended to `AgentPromptAssembler.SystemPromptHeader`: community FAQ is crowd-sourced from Discord, may be outdated or inaccurate; when relying on it, tell the user it's community discussion and not official; prefer authoritative section guides/specs when they cover the question.
- **Per-result wrapper** (Component 3) guarantees the provenance is in front of the model even late in a long turn, when the system-prompt rule has faded.

## Component 5 — preload + hold in RAM (no TTL)

**Remove the TTLs from the agent's caches.** The `agent:preload:{config}` entry loses its 30-minute absolute TTL; the agent readers (`AgentSectionDocReader`, `AgentFeatureSpecReader`, and the new `CommunityFaqReader`) lose their sliding TTL. Agent cache entries are written with **no absolute/sliding expiration and `CacheItemPriority.NeverRemove`** so memory pressure can't evict them either — once loaded, they stay for the process lifetime. This is scoped to the **agent's** caches; the user-facing `/Guide` cache and its `POST /Guide/Refresh` admin path are left exactly as they are.

**Preload once, early, without gating startup.** Add a hosted service modelled on the existing `AgentSettingsStoreWarmupHostedService`. Hook `IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStarted` and run the load **fire-and-forget off the startup path** (startup is never blocked). It populates, into RAM:

- `AgentPreloadCorpusBuilder.BuildAsync` for the active `AgentPreloadConfig` (a runtime admin tier-flip rebuilds lazily once, then is held).
- `CommunityFaqReader.ListTopicsAsync()` (the community index).
- The full documents the agent fetches on demand — every `docs/sections/*` guide and every `docs/community-kb/*` file — so tool fetches are served from RAM from the first request.

**No re-warm timer.** Nothing expires, so there is nothing to refresh on a schedule. Content changes ship in a release, and a release restarts the process, which re-runs the load — restart is the refresh. (No admin refresh endpoint for the agent; not asked for, and restart covers it.)

Key distinction this encodes: holding the docs **in RAM** makes fetches instant at **zero standing prompt-token cost** — only the small indexes are inlined into the prompt; full docs live in RAM and are served via the tools. That is what "keep the docs in RAM, serve them as a tool" means here, and why the memory cost is minimal.

Failures are swallowed and logged (a load miss must never crash the host); the lazy fetch paths still work as a fallback, so a failed preload only costs first-request latency, never correctness.

## Registration & health

- Register `CommunityFaqReader` and the warm-up hosted service in `AgentSectionExtensions` alongside the existing agent services (match lifetimes: readers singleton, hosted service via `AddHostedService`).
- Extend `AgentDocsHealthCheck` to include `docs/community-kb/` reachability (it already checks the agent's GitHub docs), so a broken corpus path surfaces in health rather than silently.

## Scale (100×) notes

- Standing prompt cost is bounded: only the one-line-per-file index is inlined; full files are fetched on demand and cached.
- Dynamic discovery → no per-file code churn as topics multiply.
- A single large topic file is returned whole by `fetch_community_faq`; fine at ~500 users / single server. If individual files later get unwieldy, the offline pipeline can split them — no app change needed.

## Testing

- `CommunityFaqReader`: topic validation (rejects traversal, rejects unknown topics), index parsing (H1 + Overview + last-updated, and the H1-only fallback), cache key isolation from the guide cache.
- `AgentToolDispatcher`: `fetch_community_faq` happy path returns wrapped content; invalid topic returns the error result.
- Provenance wrapper present in every successful community-FAQ tool result.
- Warm-up hosted service: does not block `ApplicationStarted`; a thrown warm-up does not crash the host.
- Architecture tests: the new reader and tool stay within Agent/Infrastructure and touch no vertical-section repository or DbContext.

## Open implementation questions (for the plan, not blocking)

- Whether `AgentSectionDocReader` is fronted by an interface; mirror it exactly for `CommunityFaqReader` either way.
- Confirm the agent readers' cache entries are distinct from the user-facing `GuideContentService` (`guide:`) entries, so removing the agent TTLs leaves `/Guide` untouched. If any entry is shared, split it rather than changing `/Guide` behaviour.

## Addendum (2026-06-14) — separate KB repo + admin Reload

Two revisions adopted after the initial design, during implementation:

1. **Dedicated repo, not vendored into the code repo.** The corpus lives in a standalone public repo **`nobodies-collective/knowledge-base`** (files under `docs/community-kb/`), read via a second `IGuideContentSource` (`GitHubCommunityKbContentSource`) bound to `CommunityKbSettings` (`CommunityKb:Owner/Repository/Branch/AccessToken`, defaulting to that repo's `main`). Rationale: vendoring into the Humans repo would force every content drop through the two-remote prod-promotion flow and bloat code history/PRs with non-code churn at ~100× growth. A separate repo lets content ship on its own cadence. `CommunityFaqReader` is unchanged — only its injected source differs (DI factory). The `confidential/` folder is structurally excluded by reading a clean public repo. Seeded with `docs/community-kb/_seed.md`.

2. **Admin "Reload KB" button.** `IAgentPreloadCorpusBuilder.ReloadAllAsync` (`POST /Agent/Admin/ReloadKnowledgeBase`, `AdminOnly`) force-refetches the community KB and rebuilds + atomically swaps the cached preload corpus for every tier — so content updates land without an app restart. Reload+swap: fetch fresh, then overwrite cache keys (reads keep the old value until the swap). Still no TTL; restart remains a refresh, and this adds an on-demand one.

## Addendum (2026-06-15) — stop the agent giving up; make coverage legible to the router

The shipped agent refused event/community/operations questions ("why is it called Elsewhere?", "are there female urinals this year?", "what's going on with EE?") instead of consulting the corpus, and only checked when the user pushed back — even though the answers were in the KB. Root causes, all in code: (a) the system prompt framed the agent narrowly ("how the Humans system works") and put community-FAQ consultation last and conditional (step 5, "not covered by a section guide"), behind a broad "refuse off-topic" rule; (b) the community index showed only the H1 + first `## Overview` paragraph, so terms that live only in `## Key facts` / `## FAQ` (urinals, VIPee, EE, TAP) were invisible to the router; (c) no jargon expansion. Three coordinated changes:

1. **System prompt rework (`AgentPromptAssembler.SystemPromptHeader`).** Scope broadened to the Humans app **and** the association/Elsewhere event, on-site operations, logistics, and history. The two indexes (Section + Community FAQ) are now co-equal first-resort routers in the workflow, not a late fallback. A new hard rule requires scanning **both** indexes and fetching every plausibly-relevant guide/topic — expanding abbreviations first — **before** declaring anything off-topic or escalating. "Refuse" is narrowed to genuinely unrelated requests (politics, personal/medical/legal advice, general programming); event/community/site questions are explicitly in scope. The "never invent" rule is strengthened ("no plausible-sounding guess") to kill give-up confabulations (e.g. a fabricated "low-income tickets closed March 2026"). The `fetch_community_faq` tool description is made prescriptive ("CALL THIS for event/community/on-site/logistics/history/jargon…").

2. **Routing-keyword line in the community index — generated offline, read by the app.** Each topic file declares a `## Keywords` section; `CommunityFaqReader.ExtractKeywords` reads that section (newlines collapsed to one space) and the index renders it after the Overview summary as `— covers: …`. When a file declares no `## Keywords` section the index shows the Overview summary alone (no bloat). The Overview paragraph remains the human-readable `Summary`; keywords are additive.

   **The app does not derive keywords from prose.** An earlier iteration harvested the bold lead-in of every Key-fact bullet **plus** every FAQ question verbatim **plus** the contact-name lists. That produced full sentences and people's names — not keywords — and tripled the size of the cached prefix. Real per-file keyword extraction (tokenisation, EN+ES stopwords, proper-noun handling, dedup) is an offline, reviewable concern; it belongs in the KB generator, not in app code at request time. This is the same reasoning that ruled out runtime TF-IDF below, applied to the harvest.

   **Rejected — statistical extraction *in the app* (TF-IDF / inverted term→file index at runtime).** "Most specific" terms are dominated by one-off names/dates/URLs (noise, not routing signal) and unigram tokenisation loses phrases; doing it well needs df-filtering, n-grams, and EN+ES stopword lists — work that is cheap and reviewable offline but fragile inline. The LLM is the retriever (it maps "EE"→"early entry" itself when it reads the `covers:` line), so the app only needs to *surface* the keywords, not compute them. Consistent with the original non-goal ("no embeddings/vector search; keyword/topic granularity is sufficient").

   **What the app reads.** Each topic file may declare a `## Keywords` section; the app reads from that heading until the next `##`, collapses newlines to a single space, and renders the result after `covers:`. No section → no `covers:` line. Producing the keywords (offline extraction) is the KB generator pipeline's job and lives with that pipeline, **not in this repo**. Until the KB is regenerated with `## Keywords` sections, the `covers:` line is simply absent and the give-up fix is carried entirely by change 1 (prompt rework + prescriptive tool description).
