### Access Level Logic

Viewer access is determined by:
1. **Self** → BoardOnly (sees everything)
2. **Board member** → BoardOnly (sees everything)
3. **Any coordinator** → CoordinatorsAndBoard
4. **Shares team with owner** → MyTeams
5. **Active member** → AllActiveProfiles only

## Term Lifecycle

Colaborador and Asociado memberships have 2-year synchronized terms expiring Dec 31 of **odd years** (2027, 2029, 2031...). The `TermExpiryCalculator.ComputeTermExpiry()` method computes the expiry as the next Dec 31 of an odd year that is at least 2 years from the approval date.

- On approval: `Application.TermExpiresAt` is set
- On expiry without renewal: user reverts to Volunteer tier, removed from Colaboradors/Asociados team
- Renewal: new Application entity (same tier), goes through normal Board voting
- Reminder: `TermRenewalReminderJob` sends reminders 90 days before expiry
